# SIMPLE SHELL
Simple is a simple command line prompt. This shell was built as a project for ALX School.

## Compilation
The simple shell should be compiled using GCC compiler with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## Example of how to launch the shell after compiling:
`./hsh`

* Output: prompt to terminal: `cisfun$ `

### List of useful commands
* `cat` - prints and concatenates files to the standard output
* `cp` -copies a file into another file
* `clear` - clear standard output
* `ls` - will list all files and directories in current working directory
* `mv` - helps to move one file into another file
* `cd` - change directory


### Builtins
There are two builtins programmed into the shell. Below is a description and use for each builtin.

* `env` - The env command is a command that tells the shell program to display all of the environment variables with their values. It is a    way to access those values through the shell.

* `exit` - If you wish to exit out of the shell the user can use the builtin `exit`.
