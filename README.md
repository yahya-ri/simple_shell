# SIMPLE SHELL
Simple Shell is a simple command line prompt was built for the `0x16. C - Simple Shell` project at ALX School.

## Compilation
The simple shell should be compiled using GCC compiler with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
After it is done compiling you can run the executable `hsh`

### List of useful commands
* `cat` - prints and concatenates files to the standard output
* `cp` -copies a file into another file
* `clear` - clear standard output
* `ls` - will list all files and directories in current working directory
* `mv` - helps to move one file into another file
* `cd` - change directory


### Builtins
There are two builtins programmed into the shell. Below is a description and use for each builtin.

* `env` - The env command is a command that tells the shell program to display all of the environment variables with their values. It is a    way to access those values through the shell.

* `exit` - If you wish to exit out of the shell the user can use the builtin `exit`.
